## Introduction

In todayâ€™s digital world, securing user passwords is crucial. The **Crypt** library offers a straightforward solution for hashing passwords using industry-standard algorithms. Whether you are building a web application, mobile app, or any service that requires user authentication, Crypt provides the tools you need to protect user data effectively.

## Features

- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for hashing and verifying passwords.
- **Secure Algorithms**: Supports modern hashing algorithms to ensure maximum security.
- **Customizable**: Options to configure hashing parameters based on your needs.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies for faster performance.

## Installation

To install the Crypt library, use the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/mohamedabadee/crypt
```

This command fetches the library and makes it available for use in your Go projects.

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use the Crypt library to hash and verify passwords:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/mohamedabadee/crypt"
)

func main() {
    password := "mySecurePassword"

    // Hash the password
    hashedPassword, err := crypt.HashPassword(password)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error hashing password:", err)
        return
    }

    fmt.Println("Hashed Password:", hashedPassword)

    // Verify the password
    isValid := crypt.VerifyPassword(hashedPassword, password)
    if isValid {
        fmt.Println("Password is valid!")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Invalid password.")
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to hash a password and verify it. Adjust the code as necessary to fit your application.
